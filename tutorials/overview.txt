presentation overview:

* refactor the client/server into session
* added new features - import/export from csv/df
* created stdlib (organized folder) - which includes new jsonpath+rgx, and the old functions as well
* refactor ie_functions - create register function
* feature - different rules can use the same head relation, which allows union, and later recursive rules
* pytest framework - 63 unique tests, workflows (github ci), pep8 check, mypy check
* docstrings and typing - added type hints and docstrings to all functions
* tutorials updated according to our changes - and more changes (optimizations, python vs rgxlog)
* engine refactor - move from pydatalog to sqlite:
    * refactored parse_graph, and added term_graph
    * implemented all operators in sqlite (select, join...) with jinja
    * enabled recursive rules using fixed-point nodes (naive bottom-up)
    * TODO@tom rule to term graph
